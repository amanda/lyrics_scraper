# lyrics_scraper

a simple lyrics scraper made to play with the [pattern-web module](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern-web).

## usage:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python az_scraper.py 'artistname'
```
returns a json file of lyrics by the specified artist.

## todo:
- learn that i need to stop trying to scrape websites without APIs, they don't have APIs for a reason you're just going to get your ip banned :'(
